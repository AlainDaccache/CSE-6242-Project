    "Below we can see the aggreagated data for all collected toronto bike sharing station trips represented as a force graph. Within the graph each station is represented by a circle with its size proportional to the frequency with which it appears in the trips data. Each edge between the nodes tells us that there has been a logged trip between the two stations. As we can see, the lesser utilized stations are forced to the outside. The graph is interactive allowing you to drag, pin and explore the stations."
